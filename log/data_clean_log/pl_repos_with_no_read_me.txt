keebox,This repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to boost their career in software development. üí° The division of resources by programming language makes it easy to find the information you need, and the focus on including frameworks, libraries, and other resources makes it a comprehensive resource for all types of projects.,53,https://github.com/andriksantos/keebox,master,[]
spikepp,SPIKE is a protocol fuzzer creation kit. It provides an API that allows a user to create their own fuzzers for network based protocols using the C++ programming language. The tool defines a number of primitives that it makes available to C coders, which allows it to construct fuzzed messages called ‚ÄúSPIKES‚Äù that can be sent to a network service to hopefully induce errors. SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it‚Äôs an excellent choice for our purposes.  SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.,70,https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp,master,[]
